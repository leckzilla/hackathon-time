## SoC Friday Hackathon 12/6/20 - The Whale of Derail

The theme for this hackathon was time, so inspired by Team SLA-ckers and their Whale of Derail, we decided to create a break timer using only vanilla JS in order to brush up on the old DOM manipulation.

The time is set in minutes and as soon as the countdown finishes the Whale of Derail pops up and tells you to get back to work!
